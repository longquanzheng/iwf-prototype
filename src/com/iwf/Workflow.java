/**
 * This is a simplified Cadence/Temporal workflow. All the complexity of
 * history replay and decision task processing are hidden. No matter how you modify the workflow code, it will never run
 * into non-deterministic errors. The signal/timer/activities will be defined into a way that you don't need to understand
 * what is a workflow decision task and how it's executed.
 * It preserves the capabilities of executed activities, setting timers, processing signals, upsert search attributes, and
 * setting query methods. So basically, you still have the full power of using Cadence/Temporal, without needing to understand
 * the complex technology.
 * The workflow is still defined as code but in a different way. Instead of having a whole piece of workflow method to define the
 * workflow code, you will have to split the logic and place into different states.
